# Simple-RPS-AI
A very simple Rock, Paper, Scissors AI written in Python!

## HOW IT WORKS:

The code is super simple, since Rock Paper Scissors is basically just a comparison of numbers. Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beats paper. We can put this into a list:

> ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]

Then index the list, where rock is 0, paper is 1, and scissors is 2. Then have each AI pick a random one and compare them to see if one is bigger than the other, and determine the winner!
